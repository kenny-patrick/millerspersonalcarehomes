                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Miller's Personal Care Homes, LLC is located in San Antonio, Texas. We assist veterans who do not have a need for hospital or nursing home care, but cannot live independently because of medical or psychiatric conditions.</p>
                <p>Our homes will provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Room and board</li>
                    <li>Housekeeping</li>
                    <li>Supervision</li>
                    <li>Personal care services</li>
                    <li>Assistance with daily living activities (bathing, dressing, meal preparations and laundry)</li>
                    <li>A safe environment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our homes are unique because they allow veterans limited supervision, medical management, administration of medication and oversight. Some veterans are considered to have substance abuse issues, mental health issues and may suffer from homelessness. Our staff provide the services mentioned above. We provide daily living activities consisting of exercise, community activities, past time activities and shopping.</p>
                <p>Residents must cover the expenses, and have the option to choose from different packages starting from affordable, basic level care. To our knowledge, there is funding available to veterans to assist in affording in-home expenses.</p>
                <p>The home is a licensed personal care facility and serves a great need for veterans in the state of Texas. Miller's Personal Care Homes will provide a rented room and use of communal areas with a maximum capacity of 6 residents. Our care homes are willing, ready and able to assist the veteran population with their daily needs.</p>
                <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
                <p>To provide services and support that allow our clients to remain as independent as possible in their homes or residences, while enable a quality of life for our clients and their families which cannot be achieved by other means.</p>
